# Homespring.js

> Because programming isnâ€™t like a river, but it damn well ought to be.

An incomplete and possibly incorrect implementation of Homespring (the
programming language), in Javascript OO.

## How to try it out

Open [homespring.html](homespring.html) if you want to see the salmon travel
through the river, or run `hs.js`/import and use `homespring.js` if you don't
want the neat visualisations.

## Things to do

- [ ] Make a lot of things neater
  - [ ] `tokensFactory` ðŸ¤¢
- [ ] Implement all other tokens
